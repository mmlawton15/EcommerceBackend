# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## What is this?
This project is our 13th challenge of the bootcamp where we had to work off starter code to create the backend for an eCommerce website. We were specifically focused on using what we learned during our Object-Relational Mapping chapter.

## What's the point and what did I learn?
This project is for a business t be able to keep track of their inventory and give the pre-existing front end website functionality. I learned about ORM and how it communicates betweent e backend and frontend.
